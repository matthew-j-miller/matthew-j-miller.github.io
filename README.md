##Writing Assignment 2:
Why are you taking this class?

In all honesty, the primary reason I'm taking this class is to complete my minor and because I thought, correctly, that it would be a 
challenging course. I also am taking it because I wanted to really see how the programming of complex pieces of software takes place. I 
don't really have plans to go into computer science beyond this class, but I want to at least be able to understand how the magic happens. 
After the completion of this course, I really just want to have a fundamental understanding of how software is created, operates, and 
interacts with other pieces of code.

## Writing Assignment 1:
What Software Engineering Means to Me

Up until recently, the phrase software engineering had always been a sort of vague and mildly intimidating idea of something that only 
professionals who had spent years in the field were capable of doing. However, after the work I struggled through last semester, the 
phrase has lost its edge, and it has come simply to mean writing code and utilizing it in an organized way to accomplish a task. 
Obviously, there is more to the discipline than that, and I have plenty more to learn, but the class I took before this I think has 
prepared me.
